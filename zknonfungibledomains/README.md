## Inspiration
The rise of decentralized identity has always clashed with one major concern: **privacy**. While ENS and similar systems prove ownership on-chain, they also expose sensitive associations ‚Äî domain-to-wallet links, metadata, and more.

This project was inspired by the question:  
**"Can we prove domain ownership *without revealing the domain name itself*?"**  
That idea led to **zkDomain Credentials** ‚Äî a fully private, zk-native solution.

## What it does
**zkDomain Credentials** is a privacy-preserving identity credentialing system built on the Aleo blockchain. It allows users to mint **verifiable NFTs** that prove they own a domain name ‚Äî all without revealing the domain publicly. These Credential NFTs are issued as **ZKPasses**, representing proof of domain ownership using zero-knowledge proofs.

The project combines:
- **Aleo Name Service (ANS)** for decentralized domain name registration,
- **ZKPass** for issuing private, Merkle-based identity credentials,
- **ZK ArtFactory** for minting Credential NFTs tied to ZPass proofs.

> ‚ÄúWe wanted to bridge digital identity, privacy, and ownership ‚Äî and domain names were the perfect anchor. This project proves you own something, without showing the world what that thing is.‚Äù

## How we built it
This project was built using the **Leo programming language** and deployed on Aleo's zero-knowledge blockchain.

### üîó Components Integrated:
- `aleo_name_service_registry.aleo`: For secure domain registration and metadata.
- `zpass_merkle_8.aleo`: To construct a Merkle tree representing identity traits, and issue ZPass records.
- `leo_nft.aleo`: For minting soulbound NFTs representing credential ownership.

## Challenges we ran into
- **Mapping multiple zk systems into a single transition** required complex reasoning around hashes, Merkle trees, and data types.
- Debugging with Leo's evolving toolchain meant we had to **manually simulate some logic** before testing on-chain.
- Ensuring **cross-contract compatibility** and matching data structures took detailed planning.
- Constructing **verifiable but private proofs** without leaking metadata took careful Merkle root construction.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We wrote a custom Leo program called `zknonfungibledomains.aleo` that:
1. Verifies the caller‚Äôs domain ownership.
2. Generates a ZKPass using the Merkle root of identity + domain data.
3. Mints a Credential NFT that‚Äôs **private by default** but verifiable.

## What we learned
- How to build modular zkApps using Leo and deploy to Aleo.
- Advanced concepts in **zero-knowledge Merkle proofs**, commitment schemes, and record management in Aleo.
- How to write interoperable zk programs that link NFTs, names, and identity in a seamless UX.

## What's next for ZK NonFungibleDomains (ZKNFD)
This is more than a hackathon project. The same mechanism can be used to:
- Prove ownership of domains in anonymous DAOs.
- Provide credentials for Web3 onboarding or gated access.
- Issue **privacy-first soulbound identity badges** ‚Äî all powered by Aleo.

We‚Äôre excited to keep building and invite collaborators to join in.
